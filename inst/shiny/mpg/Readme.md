This site plots your fuel consumption and efficency using data collected from the [Fuel Efficency Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmYz0DyM6mU80azhhnumXWXzrKJcTmj5mT2KHeS7lUNEibzw/viewform).  Having collected some data over a number of journeys using this form export it to CSV and upload it using the boxes in the menu. Plots will be generated for you showing your total travel distance, fuel prices by petrol station and your fuel efficency plotted with a [LOESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) smoothed line of best fit over-laid.
