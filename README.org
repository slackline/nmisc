# nmisc

Personal R package with various functions I've written.

- cams() - Plots data on climbing cams.
- cd() - Wrapper for setwd() as I'm lazy.
- pwd() - Wrapper for getwd() as I'm lazy.
- mpg() - Summarises and plots my fuel consumption data.

# Shiny Apps

The package includes some Shiny applications, one for working out fuel efficiency (`mpg`) and one showing walks on The Cullin Ridge (`skye`).
